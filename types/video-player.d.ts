 *         For HLS and MPEG-DASH, use the values hls and dash respectively and optionally specify a codec as described above.
 *         For audio only, use audio.
 *         If you also define a codec as part of a transformation, this will override the source type.
 *         Default: ['webm/vp9','mp4/h265','mp4'].
 *         The default is configured to be the most optimal combination of source types for modern browsers.
