### Packages

For your convenience, there are currently 4 variations for our package:

- `cld-video-player.min.js` - Minified version which includes all optional modules.

#### Adaptive Streaming

- HLS is supported out of the box. To use an m3u8 as the video source, you can specify sourceTypes=['hls'].

- MPEG-DASH support:
If you plan to use adaptive bitrate streaming to deliver MPEG-DASH files in your video player, include the following files in addition to the files described above:
```javascript
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dashjs/3.0.2/dash.all.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/videojs-contrib-dash/2.11.0/videojs-dash.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
Afterwards, you can specify sourceTypes=['dash'] for your video source.

### Cloudinary JavaScript library

The Core Cloudinary JavaScript library provides several classes, defined under the "`cloudinary`" domain. The reference documentation is located at https://cloudinary.github.io/pkg-cloudinary-core

#### Getting started

Create a video tag containing `cld-video-player` class and a supported skin class:
```html
<video
  id="example-player"
  controls
  autoplay
  data-cld-public-id="dog"
  class="cld-video-player cld-video-player-skin-dark">
</video>
```

Instantiate a new `cloudinary.Cloudinary` instance containing your cloudinary configuration:

```javascript
var cld = cloudinary.Cloudinary.new({ cloud_name: "demo"});
```

Instantiate a new cloudinary Video Player:
```javascript
cld.videoPlayer('example-player')
```
