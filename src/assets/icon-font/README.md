# Cloudinary Video Player Icons

## How to generate an updated icon-font

Use the utility from https://github.com/videojs/font with the custom icons in the `cld` folder and the configuration in the `icons.json` provided here.

MUI3 icons can be found [here](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/3.0.2/sprites/css-sprite/sprite-action-black.png).

Copy the generated `videojs-icons.scss` file to the `styles` folder.
